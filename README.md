#Doc Starter

Some quick styles to get started on that doc of yours.

### Uses:
- "Pure CSS": http://purecss.io/
- Some custom CSS

### Things to know
- For the project that actually compiles the CSS from SASS, go to: https://github.com/gjudki/doc-starter-master
- In an attempt to have to remember as few classes as possible while authoring the doc, I have employed a few patterns to help out:
  - The "q" and "cite" elements create  green and red callouts (repectively)
  - Nesting "i" elements gives you various text colors. This is was put in with reference to code in mind
  - The CSS uses the system UI font for Apple, Windows and Ubuntu. The idea here is to get the most amount of pretty out the least amount third party dependency. Interested? Check out: http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/11/using-system-ui-fonts-practical-guide/
